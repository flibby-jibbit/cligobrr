# cligobrr

Golang implementation of [clive](https://github.com/flibby-jibbit/clive).
`clive` was my first real Vlang project, and `cligobrr` is my first real
Golang project. I know test coverage needs to be improved, and I need to
write docs. That will all come in time. I needed to get this to a working
state so I could start translating a project at work from Vlang to Golang.
